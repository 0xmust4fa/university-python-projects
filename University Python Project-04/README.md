University Python Project - 04

This project contains 10 beginner-level Python exercises focused on basic programming concepts like arithmetic operations, loops, conditionals, input validation, and menu-driven logic.

Included Tasks:

1. Basic Arithmetic  
   Takes two numbers and displays their sum, difference, product, and division.

2. Print Numbers (1 to 10)  
   Uses a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.

3. Even or Odd  
   Determines if a user-inputted number is even or odd.

4. Sum from 1 to 50
    Calculates and prints the sum of numbers from 1 to 50 using a loop.

5. Multiplication Table  
   Multiplies a number by values from 1 to 9 and shows the result.

6. Even Numbers (3 to 29)  
   Prints even numbers between 3 and 29.

7. Find Maximum of Three Numbers  
   Takes three inputs and prints the largest one using if.

8. Text Matching  
   Continuously asks the user to re-enter a phrase until it matches the original.

9. Sum, Average, and Performance Level  
   Asks how many numbers the user wants to input, calculates the sum and average, then evaluates the performance:
   - Below 40 → Low  
   - 40–80 → Good  
   - Above 80 → Excellent

10. Simple Menu-Driven Program  
   Offers a simple menu:
   - Sum from 1 to N  
   - Print all even numbers to N  
   - Exit  
   Continues running until the user chooses to exit.

These tasks are great practice for understanding loops, conditions, user input, and basic logic building.

Happy Coding!
