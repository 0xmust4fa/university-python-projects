University Python Project - 03

This project includes three basic Python exercises focused on user interaction, lists, conditional logic, and menu-based programs. These tasks are great for practicing fundamental concepts of Python.

Tasks Included

1. Name Checking in a List
- A list of 5 predefined names is created.
- The program asks the user for their name.
- If the name exists in the list, a welcome message is shown.
- If not, the name is added to the list and a confirmation message is printed.
- Finally, the updated list is displayed.

3. Menu-Based Program
- A simple menu is displayed with 4 options:
  1. Say Hello
  2. Show numbers from 0 to 10
  3. Find the mean of 4 numbers
  4. Say Goodbye
- Based on the user's choice, the corresponding action is executed.

Goal:
These exercises aim to enhance the student's ability to work with Python input/output, loops, conditions, and basic list operations through interactive and useful programs.
