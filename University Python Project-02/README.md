University Python Project-02

This mini-project contains 4 beginner-level Python exercises designed to improve understanding of basic programming concepts such as conditions, lists, and user interaction.

Each task is saved in a separate Python file.

3. Student Performance Analyzer
Takes 3 subject scores (Math, English, Programming), calculates the average, and evaluates the performance as:
- 75–100 → عالی (Excellent)
- 50–74  → خوب (Good)
- 25–49  → متوسط (Average)
- 0–24   → نیاز به تلاش بیشتر (Needs Improvement)
