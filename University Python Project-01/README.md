📚 University Python Project - 01

Welcome to my second University Python Project!
This project focuses on practicing Python collections like sets, tuples, and dictionaries — as well as handling user input.

Each task is solved in a separate Python file for clarity and ease of testing.

---

Task Overview

1. classmates_set.py
- Create a set of 5 classmates’ names.
- Remove one name and add a new one.
- Print the updated set.

Practice: set operations — add, remove, and display.

---

2. number_tuple.py
- Create a tuple containing 5 numbers.
- Print the last number using indexing.

Practice: Accessing elements in a tuple.

---

3. province_population_dict.py
- Create a dictionary with populations of 5 Afghan provinces.
- Delete one province using del.
- Add a new province.
- Use pop() to remove another province.
- Print keys, values, and items.

Practice: dictionary operations — modify and access keys/values.

---

4. user_info_dictionary.py
- Get user's name, last name, and age as input.
- Store in a dictionary.
- Use f-string to display their age next year.

Practice: User input, dictionary usage, and string formatting.

💻 How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then run each file individually:

```bash
python3 classmates_set.py
python3 number_tuple.py
python3 province_population_dict.py
python3 user_info_dictionary.py
```

🔰 Learning Goals

- Improve familiarity with Python data structures.
- Understand user interaction via input().
- Practice clean, modular code by splitting tasks into files.

Happy coding! 🚀
